            <p>
              We love to solve everyday problems with code,big on teamwork we often meet up to brainstorm on ideas and participate in hackathons, CTFs, and other competitions as a team. 
              We create a platform that allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their skills. We believe that every student here at IIITL should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start.              
              <br />
              <br />
              We conduct sessions and workshops, hold lectures and talks, and even host coding competitions and hackathons. There is something for everyone. Whether you want to learn, participate in hackathons and win big prizes, or prepare for ACM-ICPC and GSoC, you can do it all here. We have a list of events planned up for the coming year.

                Software development is an iterative logical process that aims
                to create a computer coded or programmed software to address a

                <br />
                <br />
                Software development is generally a planned initiative that
                consists of various steps or stages that result in the creation

              <p>
                Web development is the coding or programming that enables
                website functionality, per the owner's requirements. It mainly
                deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which
                includes coding and writing markup.
                <br />
                <br />
                Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex
                web-based applications, social network applications and
                electronic business applications.

					  Competitive Programming is a sport, we mean literally. Take any

					  bat for the first time. Swing and a miss, do it couple of times
					  and you’ll eventually hit one over the ropes. Now, consider a
					  programming contest as a game of cricket, metaphorically.
					  Compile a code and submit, you may get a WA (Wrong Answer). Make
					  changes to code and eventually you will get your first AC
					  (Accepted/Correct Answer).

					  Let us give you a sneak peek, about 20% of questions in a
					  programming contest are simple conversion of plain english to a

                Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the
                capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is
                one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever
                come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the
                computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability
                to learn. <br /><br />
                Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many
                more places than one would expect.

					  Design is the craft of creating visual content to communicate

                Cyberattacks are an evolving danger to organizations, employees,
                and consumers. They may be designed to access or destroy
                sensitive data or extort money. They can, in effect, destroy

                <br />
