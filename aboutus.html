            We create a platform that allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their skills. We
            believe that every student here at IIITL should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a
            passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the
            right start.
            <br />

              Software development is an iterative logical process that aims
              to create a computer coded or programmed software to address a
              unique business or personal objective, goal or process.
              <br />
              <br />
              Software development is generally a planned initiative that
              consists of various steps or stages that result in the creation
              of operational software.

              Competitive Programming is a sport, we mean literally. Take any
              sport, let’s consider cricket for that matter, you walk in to
              bat for the first time. Swing and a miss, do it couple of times
              and you’ll eventually hit one over the ropes. Now, consider a
              programming contest as a game of cricket, metaphorically.
              Compile a code and submit, you may get a WA (Wrong Answer). Make
              changes to code and eventually you will get your first AC
              (Accepted/Correct Answer).

              Let us give you a sneak peek, about 20% of questions in a
              programming contest are simple conversion of plain english to a
              code of your favourite programming language.

              Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the
              capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is
              one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever
              come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the
              computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability
              to learn. <br /><br />
              Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many

              <br />
              <br />
              Design is the craft of creating visual content to communicate
              messages. Applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques,
              designers use typography and pictures to meet users’ specific
              needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in
              interactive designs to optimize the user experience.
