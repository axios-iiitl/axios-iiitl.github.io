          <p>
            Axios the technical club of The Indian Institute of Information
            Technology, Lucknow was constituted in 2019 with the aim to spread
            applied computer science culture among the students of our
            institute. It is a community of highly enthusiastic students doing
            coding, ethical hacking, Web Designing and all other aspects of
            programming.

            <p>
              We create a platform that allows students to gain assistance and
              mentorship to enhance their coding ability. We believe that every
              student here at IIITL should have an opportunity to learn how to
              code and develop a passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is
              getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right
              start.
              <br />
              <br />
              We conduct sessions and workshops, hold lectures and talks, and
              even host coding competitions and hackathons. There is something
              for everyone. Whether you want to learn, participate in hackathons
              and win big prizes, or prepare for the ACM-ICPC and GSoC, you can
              do it all here. We have a list of events planned up for the coming
              year.

              enthusiasm for coding in the institute and especially amongst
              freshmen.
              <br />
              From day zero, every member took steps daily to make sure that

              regionals and one made it till the West Asia Finals with a 9th
              rank in the regionals, the students even went on to win many
              hackathons, CTFs and other technical events.

                Software development is an iterative logical process that aims
                to create a computer coded or programmed software to address a

                <br />
                <br />
                Software development is generally a planned initiative that

                Web development is the coding or programming that enables
                website functionality, per the owner's requirements. It mainly
                deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which

                <br />
                <br />
                Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex
                web-based applications, social network applications and
                electronic business applications.

					  Competitive Programming is a sport, we mean literally. Take any

					  bat for the first time. Swing and a miss, do it couple of times
					  and you’ll eventually hit one over the ropes. Now, consider a
					  programming contest as a game of cricket, metaphorically.
					  Compile a code and submit, you may get a WA (Wrong Answer). Make
					  changes to code and eventually you will get your first AC
					  (Accepted/Correct Answer).

					  Let us give you a sneak peek, about 20% of questions in a

                Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the
                capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is
                one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever
                come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the
                computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability
                to learn. <br /><br />
                Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many
                more places than one would expect.
